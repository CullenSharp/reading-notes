## Overview

Released and developed by Microsoft, TypeScript is a strict superset of JavaScript that is statically typed.

## Glossary

**Compilation** – Part of the build process, compilation is the process of transforming one language into another.

**Compiler** – A bit of software written to transform one language into another.

**Dynamically Typed** – A set of languages where the type of variables is not specified, or known, before before runtime.

**High Level Languages** – These are languages which are designed to be read by humans.

**Low Level Languages** – Languages that are designed to be primarily machine readable.

**Statically Typed** – Distinct from dynamically typed languages (Python, JavaScript), this is a feature of many languages (Java, C, C++) that requires you to specify the variable type before compiling.

**Strict Superset** – A variation that has features that aren't supported in the subset. For instance, TS supports static typing which is a feature not present in vanilla JS.
