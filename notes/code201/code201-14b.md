# What Google Learned About Teams

I think this all really makes sense to me. In groups, the ones that work the best for me are ones where there's a sense of trust with all the members. I'm working to improve that right now.

A few months ago I read that you can improve a empathy and kindness through meditation. I don't know if that's true, but those things are big problem areas for me. Not that I'm not empathetic, but I often have difficulty expressing connections with people... opening up to them, or even what the right words are. Further, when is the right time to open up with a teammate. It's not something that can be done lightly or easily.

In my experience, the norm has been psychological un-safety. It most interactions with people, I'm afraid to express myself. Now, I don't know how much of that is from myself or from others, but the issue stands that such situations aren't easy to navigate for me. I'm shy.

So from the opposite perspective it's really nice to be asked about my pronouns. It's not a big deal when people don't use my preferred ones; honestly, in the grand scope of who I am, my gender identity plays only one part. Having someone be concious of themselves and others goes a long way.
