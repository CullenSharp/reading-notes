## Understanding The Problem Domain

What is the "problem domain"? It's "all the stuff that has nothing to do with the language," but what you have to understand in order to write the software ([Stack Exchange, 2011](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125926/what-is-problem-domain)). Say for instance you working on a site to sell kitchen equipment, then the problem domain is ecommerce and cooking. Essentially, the problem domain *is* the bigger picture.

How do you make the problem domain easier to understand? John Sonmez suggests that we either make the problem domain easier or get better at understanding the it. You can start by narrowing your focus to just a few parts. Build the problem out in steps, so it doesn't get overwhelming.

You can also just talk to the customer directly. This ensures that you have a better view of the problem domain.

## Object Literals, 3

An object is a way of modelling something from real world. It has properties and methods (its variables and functions). Here is an example for a hotel:

````JS
let hotel = {
    name: 'Quay',
    rooms: 40,
    booked: 20,
    gym: true,
    types: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],
    checkAvailability: function() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    }
};

//this is a call to the checkAvailability method
hotel.checkAvailability();
````

An object is composed of comma-seperated attribute and value pairs called key and value. This way the object form is very good at describing something with many parts.

The above code is also an example of the 'literal notation', and the method is accessed using dot notation. But you could also access the values like you would for an array:

````JS

let getAvailable = hotel['checkAvailability']();

````

In this case, think of the key name as the index for each value.

## Document Object Model, 5

Also called the DOM, the Document Object Model is how you explain to the browser how the HTML is modelled. Through this model you can access elements of the DOM within JS.

The DOM is repersented by the tree model. Each element has parent and children.

````HTML
<html>
    <body>
        <div id="page">
            <h1 id="header">list</h1>
            <h2>buy groceries</h2>
            <ul>
                <li id="one" class="hot">pine nuts</li>
                <li id="two" class="hot"><em>fresh</em> figs</li>
                <li id="three" class="hot">honey</li>
                <li id="four">balsalmic vinegar</li>
            </ul>
            <script src="js/list.js"></script>
        </div>
    <body>
</html>
````

There are four nodes: document nodes, element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes. The document node repersents everything, the root node. Element nodes describe the individual tags of a page (h1, ul, h2, p). Attribute nodes are the ids, classes, and metas; they aren't children, but rather are attached to the element itself. Text nodes are what's inside of those elements. Text cannot have children of its own.

![DOM Tree](https://northstar-www.dartmouth.edu/doc/idl/html_6.2/images/About_the_Document_Object_Model-1.jpg)

From here it's pretty straight forward how you're able to access and update elements in the DOM. Each element has its own path through which it can be accessed. There are a bunch of methods for accessing them:  getElementById(), querySelector(), getElementsByClassName(), getElementsByTagName(), querySelectorAll(), ParentNode, previousSibling/nextSibling, firstChild/lastChild.

Once you've got a lead on the element you want to change or access, you can get the nodes value, create children, or change attributes. At your disposal you have, nodeValue, innerHTML, CreateElement(), CreateTextNode(), appendChild() / removeChild(), hasAttribute(), getAttribute(), setAttribute(), removeAttribute().

Looking for and accessing DOM elements is called __DOM queries__. The best practice if you're going to be accessing a element multiple times is to store the query in a variable.

````JS
let itemOne = getElementById('one');
````

Now that you've cached that query, it'll make interacting and updating that element faster. In this specific example we only returned one element, but we can return multiple in a NodeList. These are groups of elements Returning a NodeList is slower. In general you want to design queries to be as fast as possible (i.e. interacting with as few elements as possible).

````JS
//This returns a NodeList with all the elements of this class
getElementsByClassName('class');

//Returns all elments of a certain tag
getElementsByTagName('tag');

//Returns all elements referenced by a given css selector
querySelectorAll('css selector');
````

All of these queries return a NodeList, or a group of nodes, when called. After you have the NodeList, it works basically like an array but is an *collection*. You can move through and select items in the list with either the square bracket notation or the item method. I'm not sure what their individual use cases are.

````JS
let elements = document.querySelectorAll('css selector');
console.log(elements[1]);
console.log(elements.item(1));
````

The following queries only return a single element. For this, they are faster.

````JS 
getElementById('id');

querySelector('css selector');
````

Query selector is a new addition to js, and it can select a broader variety of elements.

### Traversing the DOM

Once you selected an element, you can get around by using a few properties: parentNode, previousSibling, nextSibling, firstChild, lastChild. You can use these to select elements in them most efficient manner. 

````JS
let startItem = document.getElementById('one');

console.log(startItem.nextSibling.textContent);
let nextItem = startItem.nextSibling.textContent;

nextItem.replace('someString', 'anotherString');
nextItem.className = 'complete';
````

Note: certain browser insert whitespace nodes into the DOM, and this can mess you up. Internet Explorer is the only browser that doesn't do this.

### Manipulating the DOM

The next step up is to create elements inside the DOM and append them. Do this in three steps, create elements, give them content, append them to a parent element.

````JS
//create a new element
let newEl = document.createElement('li');

//create a text node
let newText = document.createTextNode('content');

//attach the text
newEl.appendChild(newText);

//find the position for the new element
let position = document.getElementsByTagName('ul')[0];

//insert the new element
position.appendChild(newEl);
````

Removing an element isn't the exact same, but it's still only three steps: store the element to be removed, store the parent, remove the element for the parent.

````JS
//element to remove
let removeEl = document.getElementsByTagName('li')[3];

//its parent
let parentEl = remoceEl.parentNode;

//remove it
parentEl.removeChild(removeEl);
````

### Manipulating attributes

Manipulating attributes can be way to change an elements styling on the fly: getAttribute(), hasAttribute(), setAttribute(), removeAttribute(). getAttribute() returns the value of a selected attribute. hasAttribute() returns a boolean based on if the element has a cetrain attribute. setAttribute() changes the attribute to a value, and removeAttribute removes the values.
