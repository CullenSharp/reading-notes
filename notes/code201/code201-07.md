## Domain Modeling

> Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.

Modeling set the vocabulary for the rest of us to use. The idea is that through research, you can accurately describe something with a set of attributes.

You create these objects with constuctors. These are functions that take values as their arguments.

````JS
let epicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
    this.epicRating = epicRating;
    this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
}

let parkourFail = new epicFailVideo (7, false);
let corgiFail = new epicFailVideo (4, true);

console.log(parkourFail);
console.log(corgiFail);
````

This returns to us an object instance of epicFailVideo that has two attributes, epicRating and hasAnimals. These can be accessed with the dot notation.

````JS 
console.log(parkourFail.epicRating);
````

This is useful if you want to make a lot of objects that have the same essential attributes or methods.

### Extending existing objects

Using the .prototype() method we can extend functionality for objects. Say we wanted to add a random number generator.

````JS
epicFailVideo.prototype.generateRandom = function(min, max) {
    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min * 1)) + min;
}

console.log(parkourFail.generateRandom(1, 5));
````

The prototype is best used when a lot of objects share the same method.

>While it certainly takes longer to locate a method on the prototype object, this technique is an established best practice in JavaScript. When a prototype is shared between two or more objects, like it is for parkourFail and corgiFail, those objects execute the same code when the generateRandom() method is called

Note: Math.round returns a value rounded to the nearest integer

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.

- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.

- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.

- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.

- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.

- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
