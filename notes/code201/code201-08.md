## CSS Layout, 15

Some browsers will treat containing elements as 0px tall if they only contain floated elements. To fix this add overflow:auto and set the width to 100%:

````CSS
    body {
        overflow: auto;
        width = 100%;
    }
````

### CSS frameworks

These guys help you out by doing some common things for you. That way you don't have to write everything from scratch, however they can add bloat and odd idenitfiers to your code.

There's a ton of these out there: Tailwind, Pure, Materialist, Bootstrap, Foundation, Bulma, UI Kit.... There's a lot of them.

*Question: How do you pick, and is it better to go without?*

### Using multiple stylesheets

You can either use the *'link'* tag for the *@import* rull to add in multiple style sheets...

*Question: What's best practice, ,ore modularity or less?*
