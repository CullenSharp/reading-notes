## Images, 16 (406-427)

Using CSS rules for height and width, we can specify the size of an image.

````CSS

img.large {
    width: 500px;
    height: 500px;
}

img.large {
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
}

img.small {
    width: 100px;
    height:100px;
}
````

Here you can see a class is being applied to each image. You can just slap the class on the image tag, and it'll be that size provided you hadn't set the size someplace else more specific.

To align images you can use float and flex box properties. 

````CSS

img.align-left {
    float: left;
    margin-right: 10px;
}

img.align-right {
    float: right;
    margin-left: 10px;
}

img.medium {
    width: 250px;
    height: 250px;
}
````

To align something to the center use the rule *margin: 0 auto*;

Setting a background image with css is pretty easy too.

````CSS

body {
    background-image: url('path to file');
}

````

By default the background image rule tiles whatever image you supplied it. To change the behavior of a background image use the background-repeat rule:

````CSS
body {
    background-image: url('path to file');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
````

The other rules the background repeat property supports are

- repeat

- repeat-x
        - repeat on the x

- repeat-y

There's also a background-attachment propety that controls the image's behavior while scrolling. It takes *fixed* and *scroll*. Further there is a value to control where the background image is placed.

````CSS
body {
    background-image: url('path to file');
    background-repeat: no-repeat;
    background-position: center top;
}
````

There are 9 options for postioning a background image center top, left top, right top, left center, center, right center, bottom left, bottom center, bottom right. Like many other css rules there is a shorthand. The order goes like background color, image, repeat behavior, background attachment, position.

````CSS
body {
    /* backgrund color: white
       image
       no-repeat
       fixed
       top right
    */
    background-image: #ffffff url('path to file') no-repeat fixed top right;
}
````

CSS also supports the use of sprites for animation.

````CSS
a.button {
    height: 30px;
    background-image: url("path to file");
    text-indent: -9999px;
    display: inline-block;
}
a#add-to-basket {
    width: 174px;
    background-position: 0px 0px;
}
a#framing-options {
    width: 210px;
    background-position: -175px 0px;
}
a#add-to-basket:hover {
    background-position: 0px -40px;
}
a#framing-options:hover {
    background-position: -175px -40px;
}
a#add-to-basket:active {
    background-position: 0px -80px;
}
a#framing-options:active {
    background-images: -175px -80px;
}
````

What's going on here is that when you hover, or click the link it's image changes to a different place in the sprite sheet. The pixel values given above act like coordinates.

SEO has two different mean ways of categorizing techniques on-page and off-page. On-page consists of adding keywords to the text and also adding alt-text to images. Off-pages techniques are basically how related sites will direct users to your content.

You can use google analystics to see the traffic on your site. It tracks how many unique users come to the site, where they're from, and what their looking at.
