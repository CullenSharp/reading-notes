## Chart.js

Chart.js is a javascript plugin for creating graphs with canvas element. It's been around for a while and is well documented.

To set it up first import the library. Then give it a type, some labels and data. Color it and presto!

````JS 
var countries= document.getElementById("countries").getContext("2d");
new Chart(countries).Pie(pieData, pieOptions);

var pieData = [
	{
		value: 20,
		color:"#878BB6"
	},
	{
		value : 40,
		color : "#4ACAB4"
	},
	{
		value : 10,
		color : "#FF8153"
	},
	{
		value : 30,
		color : "#FFEA88"
	}
];

var pieOptions = {
	segmentShowStroke : false,
	animateScale : true
}
````

## Canvas element

The canvas element is for drawing graphics on the page. It looks like this:

````HTML
<canvas width="300" height="300">
  An alternative text describing what your canvas displays.
</canvas>
````

If the canvas isn't supported, it won't render. To check if the browser supports the element:

````JS
var canvas = document.getElementById('tutorial');

if (canvas.getContext) {
  var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
  // drawing code here
} else {
  // canvas-unsupported code here
}
````

Basically the ways that it works is that you draw on a grid.

````JS 
function draw() {
  var canvas = document.getElementById('canvas');
  if (canvas.getContext) {
    var ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');

    ctx.fillRect(25, 25, 100, 100);
    ctx.clearRect(45, 45, 60, 60);
    ctx.strokeRect(50, 50, 50, 50);
  }
}
````

Here FillRectwill create a square at x:25 y:25 and be 100x100px. Make the inner 60x60px transperant, and draw the outline of a square at the center.

You can change the appearance to the items on the canvase with .fillStyle, .globalAlpha, .strokeStyle and etc. Basically, you style with properties of the ctx object.

It's also possible to draw all different styles of text. Moral here is that canvas is a very versatile element that can do whatever you want.
