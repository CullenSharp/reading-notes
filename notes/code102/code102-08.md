# Operators and Loops

notes from reading 08: Operators and Loops (2.25.21)

## comparison operators

Comparison operators compare two values against each other and evaluate to either true or false; their output is a boolean. In total, there are eight of them: ==, !=, >, <, ===, !==, >=, and <=. Two of them are slightly redundant. both === and !== mean similar things to their non-strict counterparts, but they also check for equivalency in type.

````js
"41" == 41;
//true
"41" === 41;
//false
````

If we switched out these comparison operators for !== and != respectively, the outputs would be reversed.


````js
"41" != 41;
//false
"41" !== 41;
//true
````

The other comparison operators are fairly simple. > and < check if that a value is greater than (>) or less than (<) another value. Adding = to either of the comparison operators changes them to mean *greater than or equal* to and *less than or equal to*.

## logical operators

Logical operators extend comparison operators allowing you to compare more than one value set at a time. In total, there are three of them: &&, ||, and !. Logical NOT (!) says if this thing is *not* this other thing, it passes.

````js
!(5 < 7);
//false
!(6 > 7);
//true
````

||, logical OR, says *either or*. If either of these conditions evaluate to true, output is true. But if both are false, then output is false.

````js
((5<6)||(6<7));
//true
((5<6)||(10<7));
//true
((12<6)||(10<7));
//false
````

&&, logical AND, needs both conditions to be true or else return false.

````js
((6<10) && (6<12));
//true
((6>10) && (6<12))
//false
````

## loops

Loops run on conditionals. They say, "so long as this value is true, I will run. When it is false, I will stop." There are three types of loops: for, while, and do while.

For loops are great if you need to run a certain bit of code a set number of times. It looks like this:

````js
for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    //some code
}
````

What happens here is that "some code" will run 10 times. You could say use this as a timer; once you hit a certain number, stop.

While loops are good if you don't know how long you should loop for. They loop as long as its conditional evaluates to true. You can see the value of this. Say if you have a website that's waiting for input, run code until you get that input; send the user inbox as long as the haven't input information.

````js
let thing = false;
while(thing == false) {
    //some code
}
````

Do While loops is basically the same as a while loop, but it will always run once even if the conditional is false.

````js
let i;
i = 10;
do {
    //some code
} while (i<10);
````

This example should run at least once, even though it evaluates to false.
