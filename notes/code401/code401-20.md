## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Name 5 UI frameworks (other than React)
    1. Next.js
    1. Angular
    1. Vue
    1. Svelte
    1. Ember

1. What's the difference a framework and library
    1. A framework has a very specific use case, and implementation is dictated by the framework
    1. Libraries are implementation agnostic and unopinionated. You take what you need, and your code drives the application.

## Vocab

1. Rendering
    1. Rendering is the process of converting code into DOM elements
1. Templates
    1. Templates, and templating, is the process of binding data to a built format
1. State
    1. State records information about previous events that is used to modify computation.
