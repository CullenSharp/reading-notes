# Trees

July 2nd, 2021

Binary trees, k-ary trees, and binary search trees

## vocab

- `Node` -> a node is an element in a tree typically containing values and sometimes a reference to other nodes

- `Root` -> a node at the beginning of the tree

- `k` -> a number that limits the number of tree branches

- `left` -> the node to the left of the a node on the tree

- `right` -> a node on the right side of another node on the tree

- `edge` -> an edge is the connection between a parent and its children

- `leaf` -> nodes at the very end of the tree, where there aren't any connections

- `height` -> the number of edges from root to the leaves

## traversing

### depth first

This is where we prioritize sinking to the bottom of the tree first (root -> leaves). There are a few different orders for carrying out this operation.

- pre-order `root -> left -> right`

- in-order `left -> root -> right`

- post-order `left -> right ->root`

- Pre-order: A, B, D, E, C, F
- In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C
- Post-order: D, E, B, F, C, A

Pre-order is where you start at the root and traverse to the bottom left, then down the remaining side.

In-order starts on the left most leaf, checks the left side of the tree. Ascends back up to the root, and then down the remaining right side.

Post-order starts at the left most leaf, checks the left side, then goes to the right side before reaching the root.

Traversing is o(n)
