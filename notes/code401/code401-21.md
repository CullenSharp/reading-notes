## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How does React differ from vanilla JS/HTML/CSS?
    1. The primary difference between React and vanilla scripts is that it sets rules about its implementation. While React isn't as freeform as the others, it's still pretty versatile.

1. What is the primary difference between class components and functional components?
    1. Functional components are functions rather than instance of the React.component class, as such their syntax and form is entirely different. Most if not all functionality is identical across the two designs.

## Vocab

1. Functional components
    1. These are React components written as functions rather than classes.
    1. They have a host of hooks available to them to enable React functionality

1. Children / Child components
    1. Children components are contained within a parent component:

```JS
//  3rd party resources
import React from 'react';

//  esoteric resources
import Child from './child';

function Parent() {
  return(
    <>
      <Child/>
      <Child/>
      <Child/>
    <>
  )
}

```

In this case the parent component ('Parent') is responsible for rendering children components ('Child'). Most importantly parent components act as a shared common ancestor.

### Preview and Preparation

[Making Sense of React hooks](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/making-sense-of-react-hooks-fdbde8803889)

* Functional components improve performance
* Class components lead to spaghetti code at a certain point
* Functions are easier to read
* Prevent unnecessary nesting (more classes to solve class problems)

```JS

class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```

## vs

```JS
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
}

```
