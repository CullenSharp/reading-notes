## Research and Review

1. Describe the Web Request Response Cycle
    1. The Web Request Response Cycle (WRRC) describes the shape of the relationship between server and client. A client, typically a web browser or API, sends an http request to a server to access services. The server then interacts with the resource, or rejects the request. A response is then sent to client with a status code and body.
    1. Information flows in one direction; there and back, like an echo.

1. Explain what a server is as it relates to WRRC.
    1. A server is the service `provider` for the client. As the client makes a request, the server responds to the instructions. It accesses the resources and serves back an abstraction of th resources typically.
    1. In other words, the server is a client's point of access

1. What does it mean to deploy an application?
    1. Deployment is the process of making a service accessible via a server on the web. 

## Vocab

* `server`
  * a server is a piece of hardware or software that facilitates communication between a resource or service and a client. It can be seen to literally *serve* back to the client.

* `Pub/Sub`
  * This is a design pattern for messaging in event-driven programming. A publisher dispatches message that subscribers watch for. These signals are generically typed, and are interpreted by the subscriber.

* `WRRC`
  * The web request response cycle is a cycle that defines the client/server relationship. Clients send requests to servers; servers respond to the requests.
