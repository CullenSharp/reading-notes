# Hash Tables

## What Are They?

Hash tables are data structure that stores key/value pairs indexed by a hash. It's useful because it provides us with fast and efficient lookups and additions: `O(1)`.

They are useful for storing information

## Vocab

`Hash` – The result of a hashing algorithm, which takes an incoming key as a value. The algorithm then hashes it for security purposes or otherwise, and then used as the index for the table.

`Buckets` – 'Bucket' is the word used to refer to the content stored at an index.

`Collision` – This is an event that occurs more than one key gets put in the same index

`Associative array`: An array that makes a key to a value.

## How Do They Work

By storing values at a specific index (a hashed key), we can utilize an array's O(1) read access. Instead of iterating through a list at O(n), we're able to quickly access the exact thing we need.

## Implementation

Generally, hash tables are built from arrays with a size of 1024. This is important for index placement.

<!-- what? -->

By using a linked list in each bucket, we can prevent collisions. Instead of merging and overwriting the keys, we just add new values to the end of a linked list.

## Methods

`find()`: Gets a hash from a given key and checks that it exists in the table. If it does, the algorithm with try to find the value associated with that key in the linked list.

`contains()`: Returns boolean true/false if a given key appears in the table.

`getHash()`: Takes a key, hashes it, and returns the index of that hashed key in the table
