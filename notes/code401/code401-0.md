# Event Loop and Mindset

June 12, 2021

## [The Super Mario Effect](https://youtu.be/mClJBTz9I6U)

Learning to frame the process by ignoring the failures and emphasizing the end goal. As you fail you learn and it's more important to be iterative and consistently learning.

Mark Rober's message here reminds me of another idea. That if you make the learning process public and involve more people, even in the failures, we learn more. We learn more consistently and collaboratively.

It makes me wonder, what if learning wasn't game, you know? If the process is more important than the outcome, how would we learn.

The benefit, as I see it, of Mark Rober's words here is a more comfortable and sucessful learning process. It just smells of project management, so maybe that's why I'm averse to it.

## [What the Heck is the Event Loop](https://youtu.be/8aGhZQkoFbQ)

* the browser is more than the runtime there are also APIs

  * console.log

  * setTimeout

JavaScript is single-threaded. Thinking about buckets, you have to empty it before it can be full again. This is a popular metaphor for describing how JavaScript runs. Each function creates a frame in the stack (A Last In First Out data structure). As each task is completed, it gets popped off until the there are no longer any tasks.

**After** the stack is emptied, the event loop starts firing off. Going through the event queue (FiFo) each event is handled until there are no events left.

### The process

* Read the problem twice

    * Understanding the problem is where you should spend the most of your time

* Solve it manually for three data sets at least

    * You can use mathmatical induction to increase the complexity of the problem

* Optimize the manual solution

* Write the pseudo-code

* Convert the pseudo-code to functioning code

* Optimize the written code

People often undervalue their time. Don't be one of these people. Time is precious. If you feel like something is a waste of time, it might be. Do things that are worth your time, and don't compromise.

Understand the problem, break it down until you can read it and write it. Explain the problem and plan the solution. Try many approaches and be curious. Be persistent as always.

Reminds me of the practice of dynamic problem solving, which was only a touch harder to understand. The basic principle is that you take a problem and break it down into sub-problems. Solve the sub-problems and combine the solutions. Optimize until satisfied.

## [5 Whys](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMC_5W.htm)

Ask why, then why, then why, then why, then why again. Don't just solve the problem, prevent it. 5 why's is only a general rule, it could be more or less.
