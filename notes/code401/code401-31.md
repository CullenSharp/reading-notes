# Redux - Combined Reducers

![last seen](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/CullenSharp/reading-notes)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?
    * React Context Doesn't have anything like Redux Devtools
    * The ability to track state changes
    * We can use middleware
    * Context is just for passing values into nested subtrees. It is not a state management tool
1. What is the purpose of a reducer?
    * A reducer is a function that allows us to write explicit directions for how state should change.
1. What does an action contain?
    * __Type__ → a string that tells the reducer which behavior it should perform
    * __Payload__ → The data necessary to complete the action
1. Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?
    * State is read-only
    * Making a copy prevents unexpected mutations
    * Reducers are required to be [__pure__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function), meaning they shouldn't mutate data

## Vocab

* immutable state
  * State should not be mutated, instead it should be copied
* time travel in redux
  * Time travel records dispatched actions and can return to previous states without reloading
* action creator
  * Functions that create actions.
* reducer
  * A function that reducers actions and state into a new state
* dispatch
  * Dispatch is a function that sends actions to the reducer
