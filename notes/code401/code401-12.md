## Review and research

1. What is the benefit of transforming data into packets?
    1. The benefit is that each packet can take different routes to the destination. Additionally, if one or two packets get lost, the entire transmission won't be lost

2. Why is UDP connectionless?
    1. UDP sends regardless of a connection.

3. Can a socket server application have multiple socket connections?
    1. UDP never reaches a connection state, so it doesn't matter if multiple streams go to the same place.
    2. TCP connections are identified by a 4-tuple... more on that later

4. Can a socket application have multiple server connections
    1. Just as a server can have multiple connections, an application can connect to many servers

5. Can an application be both a socket server and socket connection
    1. Yes, an application can both listen for an emit

<!-- What is the difference between socket server and connection? -->
<!-- I mean what do they mean -->

## Vocab

- [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern)
  - The observer pattern is a [software design pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern) in which an object (subject) maintains a list of all dependents (observers), and notifies them of any state changes
- Listener
  - An event listener is synonymous with the observer of the Observer Pattern. In essence, it listens to a subject for state changes sometimes called events.
- Event Handler
  - A bit of software, an algorithm, written to handle an event or state change as observed by a listener
- [Event Driven Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming)
  - Event Driven Programming is a paradigm in software development where the flow of a program is defined by events
- Event Loop
  - An event loop is always looking for new incoming events. As they come in the appropriate handler is called. The next event has to wait for the last event to resolve
- Event Queue
  - Where the events live. As new events come in, they are added to the queue. Each item must resolve before the next can be handled.
- Call Stack
  - The call stack describes a design pattern where each function call pushes a stack frame onto the stack. The last call has to be completed before the next.
- Emit/Raise/Trigger
  - To fire off an event
- Subscribe
  - To watch and listen for state changes
- database
  - A structured set of data held within a computer

## Read and Skim

[Web Sockets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebSocket)

> WebSocket is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection.

> WebSocket "is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries," thus making it compatible with HTTP. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header[1] to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.
