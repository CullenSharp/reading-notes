![last seen](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/CullenSharp/reading-notes)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the similarities between AWS API Gateway + Lambda functions and an ExpressJS Server
    1. Their essentially the same thing as far as I can tell, but one is virtual and lives on the cloud (AWS).

1. List the AWS Database offerings and talk about the pros and cons of each
    1. AmazonRDS – relational database
        1. Cost efficient and easily resizable 
        1. Automates hardware provisioning, database setup, patching and backups
        1. Easy migration
    1. DynamoDB – nosql database
        1. Low-latency
        1. Durable
        1. ACID compliant
    1. ElastiCache – in-memory
        1. *Extreme* performance
        1. Scalable
        1. fully managed
    1. Redshift – relational data warehouse
        1. Fast querying
    1. Keyspaces – Apache Cassandra compatible
        1. Compatible with Cassandra (CQL)
        1. High performance at scale
        1. Fully managed
    1. QLDB – ledger
        1. Fully managed
        1. Owned by a central trusted authority
        1. Immutable and transparent
    1. Timetream – time series
        1. Fully managed
        1. Fast queries
        1. Cost effective over relational dbs
        1. Simplifies data-lifecycle management

1. What’s the difference between a FIFO and a standard queue?
    1. FIFO ensure that packets are only seen once, and in a verifiable order. This limits throughput
    1. Standard queues are 'seen at least one', so there may be duplicates. They have a much higher throughput

1. How can the server be assured a message was properly received?
    1. By sending a response back to the client

## Vocab

1. Serverless API
    1. A cloud-based API

1. Triggers
    1. These are event sources

1. Dynamo vs Mongo
    1. Dynamo is AWS' NoSQL service
        1. Fully managed out of the box
        1. Supports limited data types and smaller item sizes;
        1. Uses tables, items and attributes
    1. Mongo is self-installed
        1. Fully managed with Atlas
        1. Uses JSON-like documents
        1. Supports more data types and has fewer size restrictions.

1. Dynamoose vs Mongoose
    1. Dynamoose is an ORM for DynamoDB
    1. Mongoose is an ORM for Mongo
