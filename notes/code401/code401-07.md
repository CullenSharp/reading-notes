## vocabulary

| term | definition |
| --- | --- |
| Client ID | The client ID is the unique identifier provided to an app upon registration |
| Client Secret | The Client Secret is a unique and confidential value held between the authorization server and authorized clients. It restricts the issuing of access tokens to trusted requestors [(source)](https://auth0.com/docs/applications). |
| Authentication Endpoint | An API endpoint used for requesting access to resources|
| Access Token Endpoint | An API endpoint for requesting a token |
| API Endpoint | This is the touch point between applications that points to the necessary resources; in other words where your request goes |
| Authorization Code | "A random string generated by the authorization server and returned to the application as part of the authorization response. The authorization code is relatively short-lived and is exchanged for an Access Token at the token endpoint when using the Authorization Code Flow." [(source)](https://auth0.com/docs/glossary)|
| Access Token | "A credential that is used by an application to access an API. It informs the API that the bearer has been authorized" [(source)](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-tokens)|

- JWT is an Open Standard

Form: `aaaaaaaa.bbbbbbbb.cccccccc`
ÃŸ
- A's repersent the header of the token
  - includes the encoding algorithm
  - includes token type
- B's repersent the payload
  - claims
  - additional metadata (name, role)
- C's repersent the signiture
  - encodes the header and payload with the client secret
