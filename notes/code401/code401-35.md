## Google Backtracks, Says Its AI Will Not Be Used For Weapons or Surveillance

Google had initiated a project with the pentagon titled *Project Maven*. Its intent was to use AI facial recognition software to analyze drone footage and identify potential targets. Their withdrawal from the project was due to employee protests.

The question here is, "how can Google condone such a blatantly harmful project?" What stood out to me about this article was that employees played a big role in the decision. There was another article on Google arguing that employees should elect representatives to the board. They should elect people to review the ethics of the board's decisions. I whole heatedly agree. Further, the entire board should be run by employees. The company should be employee owned.

## Will Democracy Survive Big Data and Artificial Intelligence?

Will governance be decided by machines? I'm reminded of a book I read earlier this year: *The People's Republic of Walmart*. It made a point that automation and big data should be used to alleviate problems rather than line pockets. If algorithms make us richer, they should be used to solve serious material problems. We could eliminate immoral work conditions, hunger, poverty.
