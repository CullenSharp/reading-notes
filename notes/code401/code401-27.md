## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe use cases for `useMemo()` and `useReducer()`
    1. `useReducer()` is useful if you have complex data-types that in state, or if the current state relies on the previous one
    1. `useMemo()` returns a memoized value. If you have an expensive function that will potentially run redundantly, `useMemo()` will cache the results and update for significant changes
1. Why do custom hooks need the use prefix?
    1. Prefixing a custom hook with "use" tells us right away that the [rule of Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) apply to it.
1. What do custom hooks usually do?
    Typically they consume state and return a getter (stateful value) and a setter. They allow us to share stateful logic without adding components to our tree.
1. Using any list of custom hooks, research and name one that you think will be useful in your applications
    1. [useArray â€“ React Hanger](https://github.com/kitze/react-hanger), this would be useful for our latest lab, as it would simplify array modification
1. Describe how a hook that fetches API data might work
    It would consume fetch configuration, call fetch, and return the response as a stateful value

## Vocab

1. Reducer
    1. A reducer is a function that consumes state and an action that modifies state in a prescribed way
