# Stacks and Queues

## Stacks and Queues: what are they?

Both are abstract data types with their own kind of operations. Some common terminology includes:

  1. Push - nodes are added to the top of the stack
  2. Pop - a nodes at the top are removed from the stack
  3. Top - is the node that was pushed on to the stack
  4. Peek - look at, but don't modify, the top node in the stack
  5. isEmpty - returns a boolean if the stack is empty

A stack is Last In First Out or First In Last Out. It consists of a set up nodes. New nodes get pushed to the top of the stack, then popped of until the stack empties. A common analogy used to explain this type of data structure starts with considering a stack of plates. You can't get to the bottom, well not easily that is, without going through all the plates.
