# Custom Hooks

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does a component's lifecycle refer to?
    1. A component's lifecycle refers to the cycle of mounting, updating, and unmounting

1. Why do we sometimes have to 'wrap' functions with the useCallback hook in useEffect?
    1. Every time the site is re-rendered, new places in memory are created for each inline function. The useCallback() hook memoizes the function, and keeps it consistent across renders

1. Why are functional components preferred over class components?
    1. Class components are verbose, and harder for the machine to minify. This leads to productivity and performance issues

1. What is wrong with the following code?
    1. It doesn't loop through the array?

```JS
import React, {useState, useEffect} from 'react';

function MyComponent(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  function changeCount(e) {
    setCount(e.target.value);
  }

  let renderedItems = []

  for (let i = 0; i < count; i++) {
    useEffect( () => {
      console.log('component mount/update');
    }, [count]);

    renderedItems.push(<div key={i}>Item</div>);
  }

  return (<div>
     <input type='number' value={count} onChange={changeCount}/>
      {renderedItems}
    </div>);
}
```

## Vocab

1. State Hook
    1. The State hook is for creating stateful components
1. Effect hook
    1. The effect hook is a highly configurable hook that allows you to create lifecycle functions
1. Reducer hook
    1. The reducer hook allows you to create custom reducers for managing state
