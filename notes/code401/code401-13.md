## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What does it mean that web sockets are bidirectional? why is this useful?
    1. Being bidirectional means that the communication over web sockets is full-duplex. Packets can be sent in both directions. This is useful because it allows greater and faster collaboration between clients and servers.

1. Does socket.io use HTTP? Why?
    1. As with any web socket connection, an HTTP connection has to be upgraded using an HTTP header. This is referred to as the `handshake`. Once the handshake has been made, communication can occur over websocket with tcp.

    <!-- this shit above may be wrong.... -->

    >The client will try to establish a WebSocket connection if possible, and will fall back on HTTP long polling if not. [(socket.io - docs)](https://socket.io/docs/v4/index.html)

1. What happens when a client emits an event?
    1. When client emits an event, it travels to the server

    > The Socket.IO API is inspired from the Node.js [EventEmitter](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/events.html#events_events), which means that you can emit events on one side and register listener son the other

1. What happens when a server emits an event?
    1. It's heard by all the listeners (clients).

1. What happens if a client "misses" an event
    1. the event is buffered until reconnection

1. How can we mitigate this?
    1. You can implement buffers or message queues to store the events.

## Vocab

1. Socket
    1. Sockets are classes that enable communication between servers through a [namespace](https://socket.io/docs/v4/namespaces/#Main-namespace) (`/` by default)
    2. They are based on Node.js event emitters
    3. They use an underlying [manager](https://socket.io/docs/v4/client-api/#Manager) to communicate
1. Web Socket
    1. A Web Socket is an API that allows for open bidirectional communication
1. Socket.IO
    1. Is a long polling/WebSocket based 3rd party transfer around Node.js
1. Client
    1. A client a machine that communicates with a server
1. Server
    1. A server communicates with clients
1. OSI Model
    1. The OSI model (Open Systems Interconnection Model) is a seven layer model to describe networks. Each layer has a group of protocols associated with it to help the process along.
    1. The `application` layer forms the top layer and consists of software that connects to the internet
    1. The next layer is the `presentation layer`, and is data is formatted and encrypted
    1. `Session layer` controls connections, ports and sessions
    1. `Transport layer` is where data is transmitted over UDP or TCP
    1. `Network Layer` sets the path your data will take to traverse the internet
    1. `Data link` defines the formate of data on the network
    1. `Physical` the nuts and bolts, the hardware layer

7. TCP Model
    1. The TCP/IP model (Transmission Control Model and Internet Protocol) serve as the basis for all other communication protocols used by the internet.
    1. It defines end-to-end communication by dictating the packetization, addressing, transmission, reception, and routing

1. TCP
    1. TCP is the transmission control protocol and delivers a steady stream of ordered packets.
    1. It's connection oriented, meaning that a connection has to be established before transmission
1. UDP
    1. The User Datagram Model is a connectionless communication protocol. It isn't ordered, and is unreliable.
    1. Its major advantage over TCP is that it's faster. Applications that care about speed rather than reliability will use UDP.
1. Packets
    1. Packets are formatted units of data carried by a network consisting of instructions and user data.
