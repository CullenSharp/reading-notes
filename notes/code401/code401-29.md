## Overview

A graph is a collection of variously connected nodes called vertices. They are non-linear by design

## Vocabulary

* Edge: a connection between vertices
* Vertex: a node in the graph
* Neighbor: adjacent nodes connected by an edge
* Degree: the number of edges connected to a node
* Directed: an edge is one way
* Undirected: an edge is bidirectional
* Complete: all vertices are connected to all vertices
* Connected: all vertices have at least one connection
* Disconnected: some vertices have no connections
* Adjacency matrix: a representation of a graph as a matrix
* Adjacency list: a representation of a graph as a list
* Cyle: one cycle is to start and end in the same place
* Cyclic: a graph can be traversed through and end at the beginning
* Acyclic: a graph that doesn't have any cycles

## Traversal

Traversing a graph is a lot like traversing a tree, but there is potential for cycles. To avoid an infinite loop we need to keep track of the nodes we visited
