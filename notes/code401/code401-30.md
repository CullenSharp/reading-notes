![last seen](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/CullenSharp/reading-notes)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”
    1. Cookies are readable server-side unlike localStorage.
    1. Cookies can be set to expire
    1. Not vulnerable to XSS attacks

1. Explain 3rd party cookies.
    1. 3rd party cookies are just ones that are stored under a different domain name than the one being visited

1. How do pixel tags work?
    1. They work by creating a 1x1 size pixel graphic that is loaded when a user moves from view to view.
    1. They give comprehensive information about the user's behavior

## Vocab

* cookies
  * These are 4kb files that persist between pages
  * They store information in key:value pairs and can be persisted

* authorization
  * This is the process of allowing/denying access to resources
* access control
  * This is typically a list of permissions sometimes based on a user's role. Access control adds a second layer of defense after authentication.
* conditional rendering
  * Something is conditionally rendered if it's dependent on some conditional logic.
