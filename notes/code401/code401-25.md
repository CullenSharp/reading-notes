# Hooks API

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why do we *not* need more .html pages in a multi-page React app?
    1. Instead of rendering multiple pages, a single page app re-renders the contents of a single page dynamically. The client gets all the pages contents, and moving to other 'routes' tells the page which resources to use.

1. If we wanted a component to show up on every page, where should we put it
    1. To render a component on every page put it inside of `<Router>` but not behind a `<Route>`.

1. What does routing do with the components that were rendered when a new route is requested
    1. The previous components unmount, and the new ones mount to the page... idk how that works though.

1. What does props.children contain
    1. It's the head between the ears, the text in between the tags. The text or components that are inside of the component itself is attached to props.children [(source)](https://reactjs.org/docs/glossary.html#propschildren).

## Vocab

1. Composition
    1. This is the technique of combining smaller functions to build more complicated ones
1. Children/child components
    1. Child components are React components that are rendered by another component
1. Hash routing
    1. Hash routing uses the [hash part](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Location/hash) of the url to keep contents and address in sync
1. Link routing
    1. Declarative routing that takes advantage of the history api
