## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Describe the 'cloud'.
    1. The cloud is an abstract model for a distributed collection of networked machines. In other words, anything that isn't local is in the cloud

1. What is a container?
    1. A container is a closed environment containing all the environment variables necessary to run a given program. Specific language runtimes, dependencies, libraries, etc. all grouped together.

1. What is auto-scaling?
    1. Auto-scaling is the process of monitoring application loads and adjusts capacity to maintain smoothing performance.

1. What is bandwidth?
    1. Bandwidth is the maximum rate of transfer for data across a path.

1. How do cloud providers computer service costs
    1. Costs are based on operating and maintenance expenses for the network divided by the number of racks used by a company.

## Vocab

1. Server instances
    1. Server instances are single copies of a given software running on a physical server

1. Containers
    1. Containers are self-contained environments for applications to run int. They are lightweight and carry with them all the dependencies necessary to run.

1. Cloud Services
    1. Cloud services are on-demand applications and tools that live on the cloud (server).

1. Cloud Architecture
    1. Cloud Architecture refers to the systems that are designed to harness the capabilities of cloud computing

1. AWS
    1. Amazon Web Services is Amazon's cloud computing service. It includes an entire ecosystem of tools, services, and applications that make building web apps easier.

1. EC2/Elastic Beanstalk vs Heroku
    1. Heroku is actually just a wrapper for Elastic Beanstalk, which is a service for deploying web applications with EC2. EC2 stands for Elastic Cloud Computing, and is a service for provision server space and creating VMs.
