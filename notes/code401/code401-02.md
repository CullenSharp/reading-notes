## PUT and PATCH, what's the difference?

The primary difference is that PUT uses a URI to replace the original version of the resource, while PATCH provides instructions to modify the resource

*could you call it shallow vs deep?*

## Services or tools to "mock" an API for development

- [JSON-Server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server)

- [Mirage js](https://miragejs.com/)

- [Pretender](https://github.com/pretenderjs/pretender)

- [Postman](https://www.postman.com/postman/workspace/postman-public-workspace/documentation/12959542-c8142d51-e97c-46b6-bd77-52bb66712c9a)

## APIDoc.js vs Swagger

> Without documentation you api is useless

The two tools are built for creating api documentation. APIDoc.

- APIDoc converts inline documentation comments into api documentation

The benefit of having documentation written with comments in the source code is that it keeps the documentation and code close together. Seeing the documentation side-by-side to the api code makes it easy to update documentation as you update routes.

You specify the place to look for these comments when you run the command:

```BASH
npx apidoc -i ./ -e node_modules -o ./docs
```

This says include the current directory but exclude 'node_modules', then output to './docs'. The output is a bunch of static HTML pages that you can open in your browser. Obv you could deploy this to GitHub pages for instance.

```JS
/**
 * @api {get} /user/:id Request User information
 * @apiName GetUser
 * @apiGroup User
 *
 * @apiParam {Number} id Users unique ID.
 *
 * @apiSuccess {String} firstname Firstname of the User.
 * @apiSuccess {String} lastname  Lastname of the User.
 */
```

- Swagger uses JSON style documentation to be used by swaggerUI

Unlike APIdocs, Swagger uses a JSON file to create the documentation. The benefit of this is that you can keep the source code and documentation seperate. It keeps your code cleaner, and the documentation it produces is honestly kind of cool looking.

Compiling also happens in realtime via an online editor.

[HTTP response status codes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)

1. informational responses (100-199)
2. successful responses (200-299)
3. redirects (300-399)
4. client errors (400-499)
5. server errors (500-599)

## SOAP vs REST, what's the difference

SOAP - Simple Object Access Protocol

REST - Repersentational State Transfer

## Document the vocabulary

- Web server, a web server is the software and underlying hardware that accept requests that distribute web pages

- Express is a lean framework for creating applications with Node.js

- Routing is the process of directing requests and traffic over a network

- [WRRC](https://medium.com/@jen_strong/the-request-response-cycle-of-the-web-1b7e206e9047), the Web Request Response Cycle is the cycle of requests by clients to web servers that deliver web pages

## Preview

1. Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have clarity on?

Node.js is a runtime for use outside of the browser

Express is unopinionated.

Refactoring is a key component of TDD

2. Which 3 things are you looking to learn about in lecture?

what is a template?

What are some middleware libaries I can use?

What does 100% coverage mean

3. What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how they work?

Middleware libraries, especially the express middleware library

APIdoc and Swagger
---

Node is a runtime intended for use outside the browser context, and as such omits browser-specific apis in favor of traditional os apis
