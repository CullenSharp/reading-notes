# Redux - Asynchronous Actions

![last seen](https://img.shields.io/github/last-commit/CullenSharp/reading-notes)

## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. How granular should your reducers be?
    1. Reducers should be single responsibility and easy to maintain [[3]](https://redux.js.org/usage/structuring-reducers/splitting-reducer-logic)[[4]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/947874/what-is-functional-decomposition).
1. Pro or Con – multiple reducers can “fire” when a commonly named action is dispatched
    1. Pro: you can reuse state logic across slice reducers [[1]](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)
    1. Pro: Better scaling [[1]](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)
    1. Con: Expensive UI updates [[1]](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)
    1. Con: Invalid state [[1]](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)
1. Name a strategy for preventing the above
    1. Use a batching addon that results in a single update [[1]](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)
    1. Dispatch a single action rather than multiple [[1]](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)

## Vocab

<!-- what is bikeshedding, anti-patterns, and  -->

* store
  * An object with several methods on it
  * Holds the whole state tree [[5]](https://redux.js.org/api/store)
  * Methods
    * `dispatch(action)`
      * Dispatches an action (the only way to trigger a state change)
    * `getState()`
      * Returns the current state tree
    * `subscribe(listener)`
      * Adds a change listener that will be fired on any change
    * `replaceReducer(nextReducer)`
      * Replaces the current reducer with another

* combined reducers
  * A helper function that combines a number of reducers into one [[6]](https://redux.js.org/api/combinereducers)

> Note: According to the Redux style guide, an app should only have one reducer [[1]](https://redux.js.org/style-guide/style-guide)

* root reducer
  * The reducer that is passed in at create store

* slice reducer
  * A reducer that is responsible for updating a slice of state

* reducer
  * Any function with the signature `(state, action) -> new state`
