## Review, Research, and Discussion

1. Why is access control important
    1. Access control is important as another layer to authentication. Just because someone is trusted to do one job doesn't mean they should have access to everything.

2. Describe an application that would need RBAC
    1. A blog might need access control. Someone who visits the site would have permission to read the blogs contents but not alter them. Only writers or admins should have that privilege. Further, if the blog has many writers, only posts authored by a given author should be editable.

3. What is a role used for?
    1. A role is used to determine a user's permissions/capabilities

4. Why is role based access control more scalable than discretionary or mandatory access control?
    1. role based access is based on roles rather than users. Changing capabilities for a role would have the cascading effect of changing all user's with that role; this is much simpler than applying privileges on a case-by-case basis.
