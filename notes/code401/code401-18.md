# AWS: API, Dynamo and Lambda

## Review and Research

1. What are serverless functions
    1. Serverless functions are written to server a single problem. They are then deployed to the cloud.

1. If you were to create a system that emulated Lambda functions, how would you do it?
    1. I would keep a lot of what's working. Functions would follow SOLID principles and strict permissions. I would also make it so these new functions took less time to create and deploy.

1. Describe how a CDN works
    1. CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) are collections of geographically distributed servers working together to deliver web content reliably. They work by virtually shortening the distance between a client and requested web content. This is done by caching relevant information in PoPs (Points of Presence). These are geographically dispersed servers. With more content in more locations you increase coverage and reduce latency.

## Vocab

1. Serverless functions
    1. containerized functions that live on the cloud and serve a single purpose

1. Cloud Storage
    1. Digital data is stored in logical pools on the cloud. Physically, your data is present on multiple servers

1. CDNs
    1. Content Delivery Networks are collections of geographically distributed servers created to decrease latency for users requesting web content.
