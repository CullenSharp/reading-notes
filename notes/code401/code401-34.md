## Review, Research, Discuss

1. Compare and Contrast Redux Toolkit with Redux “Ducks”
    1. With Ducks, you have to write action creators and a reducer that acts as a switching point
    1. RTK does all of this for you, and removes some lines of code
1. What is the principle advantage of Redux Toolkit
    1. Using RTK removes a bit of complexity and a few lines of code.

## Vocab

1. redux toolkit slices
    1. Slices in RTK are just slice reducers
1. namespace
    1. While you can create slices, all slices respond to all actions.
    1. A namespace is used to separate reducers with similar events that need different behaviors
