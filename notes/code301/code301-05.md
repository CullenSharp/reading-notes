In this reading we're expaning on the React workflow step-by-step.

## Step 1: Break the UI into a component hierarchy

>UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture

![Draw boxes around each element](https://reactjs.org/static/eb8bda25806a89ebdc838813bdfa3601/6b2ea/thinking-in-react-components.png)

orange = whole app\
blue = search bar\
green = table\
turquoise = product category row\
red: row for each product\
\
The idea is to follow the single responsibility principle; a component should only be responsible for one thing.

build a hierarchy:

* FilterableProductTable
  * SearchBar
  * ProductTable
    * ProductCategoryRow
    * ProductRow

The designer probably has good names for the components... ask them. Once the plan is set, start with a static version of the app.

## Step 2: Build A Static Version in React

>t’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing.

----

## Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State

From here, we'll add interactivity. That means adding state and handlers. First, we'll model out a minimal version of state. The goal is to be both DRY and as minimal as possible.

* Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.

* Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.

* Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

----

## Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live

We then identify where the state should live. For each piece of state in your application:

* Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

* Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

* Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

* If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

----

## Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow

To achieve inverse data flow we pass handlers down to the children components. This will allow them to affect the state of the enclosing component.
