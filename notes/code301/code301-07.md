# REST 04.20.2021

## What Google Learned

Psychological safety is a very important concept. It means being able to trust your team when things don't go as planned. It comes with a good deal of emotional sensitivity, but it needn't be a difficult goal. What Google found was that teams with a good amount of emotional intelligence and psychological safety performed better as a team, and this goes beyond previous metrics.

## How I explained rest to my brother

> ME: Because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. It's the foundation of the web. You can think of it like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information ([Riggio](https://gist.github.com/brookr/5977550))

The whole web is built on REST. It creates the resource, and the webpage describes that resource. Which is found via a url.

APIs or Web Services: how machines use the web like people do; sending resources to and from eachother.

> url: "the machine equivalent of a noun"

- HTTP GET (Retrieve)

- HTTP POST (Send)

- HTTP PUT (Replace)

- HTTP DELETE (Delete)
