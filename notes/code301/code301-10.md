## The JavaScript Call Stack

- What is a call stack

- function execution happens one at a time and from top to bottom

> LIFO: When we say that the call stack, operates by the data structure principle of Last In, First Out, it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.[(Freeborn)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/)

- What is a stack trace

```JS
function firstFunction(){
  throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
}

function secondFunction(){
  firstFunction();
}

function thirdFunction(){
  secondFunction();
}

thirdFunction();
```

The first function is on top because it was the last one out.

### What is a stack overflow

> A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.[(Freeborn)](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/understanding-the-javascript-call-stack-861e41ae61d4/#what-causes-a-stack-overflow)

![Error log](https://miro.medium.com/max/500/1*LHpmsxV3f2znpxhuAFuIqA.png)

- **_uncaught_** means the error was improperly handled

- Typeerror is the type of error

- The red is the call stack

### Debugging

You can add breakpoints and debug from vscode

- f5 opens the debugger

- console.trace() will show the current trace in the console


### Try{} Catch{}

> The worthiest outcome of using try…catch tough is the fact that your application will keep on running, maybe with some side effects due to the fact that numberResult now contains an empty array but at least it didn’t just crash onto itself (just make sure the code you have afterwards is bearing in mind the default values of the errors)[(Spinola)](https://codeburst.io/javascript-error-messages-debugging-d23f84f0ae7c).
