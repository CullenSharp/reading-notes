# APIs 04.21.2021

## Web Api Design

Modern web APIs should support:

- Platform Independence

  - You can call an API from anywhere internally by using the agreed upon format for data exchange

- Service evolution

  - As the api changes, client apps should continue to function without modification

### Introduction to Rest

**_Rest = Respersentational State Transfer_**

> It's an architectural style for building distributed systems based on hypermedia

- Rest doesn't bind us to any implementation unlike http

- "Rest Apis are designed around resources"

- Every resource has an identifier: a uri. That's the "1" on the end of this url

```HTTP
https://adventure-works.com/orders/1
```

- common operations

  - GET

  - POST

  - PUT

  - DELETE

  - PATCH

- REST APIs are stateless because requests happen in any order

- REST APIs are driven by hypermedia links within the repersentation

```JSON
{
    "orderID":3,
    "productID":2,
    "quantity":4,
    "orderValue":16.60,
    "links": [
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"GET" },
        {"rel":"product","href":"https://adventure-works.com/customers/3", "action":"PUT" }
    ]
}
```

- URIs should be based on nouns rather than verbs

```HTTP
https://adventure-works.com/orders // Good

https://adventure-works.com/create-order // Avoid
```

- Avoid creating APIs that simply mirror the internal structure of the database. Don't expose clients to internals

- Keep URIs simple and relational

  - avoid URIs more complex than \
    _collection/item/collection_

- Keep naming conventions consistent

  - A collection should be plural: objects

  - A single object should be singlular: 1

> think of APIs as an abstraction of the database
