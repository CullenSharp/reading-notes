## An introduction to Node.js on sidepoint

Here we'll get a summary of what node.js is.

### Node is built on Chrome V8

- V8 is an open-source js engine that runs in chromium based web browsers

- Node.js is a runtime

> This means that Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it’s a JavaScript runtime ([Hibbard](https://www.sitepoint.com/an-introduction-to-node-js/)).

### How do I install node.js

- use a version manager to switch between different versions of node

  - nvm comes bundled with node.js

- Node.js by virtue of being built on v8 can use the most modern version of the js syntax

```JS
function upcase(strings, ...values) {
  return values.map(name => name[0].toUpperCase() + name.slice(1))
    .join(' ') + strings[2];
}

const person = {
  first: 'brendan',
  last: 'eich',
  age: 56,
  position: 'CEO of Brave Software',
};

const { first, last } = person;
const emoticon = [ ['┌', '('], ['˘', '⌣'], ['˘', ')', 'ʃ'] ];

console.log(
  upcase`${first} ${last} is the creator of JavaScript! ` + emoticon.flat().join('')
);
```

### NPM, node package manager

- npm is also the largest software repo

  - over a million packages

#### Installing a package

- globally

```CONSOLE
npm install -g jshint
```

- locally

```CONSOLE
npm init -y
npm install lodash --save
```

Npm init -y creates a package.json file, and the second command installs the package locally

### Working with package.json

- npm install will install all required dependencies

  - these will be listed in package.json

### What is node.js used for

- installing (npm) and running (Node) are the two primary functions of node.js

- Node.js lets us run js on the server

- Node.js is single threaded an event driven

  - do one thing at a time and run when events trigger

  - very little overhead and a lot of simultaneous processes can be run

### CONS

- avoid blocking i/o calls

  - intensive i/o calls could crash the whole process. Everything must be handled correctly

### A quick http server

```JS
const http = require('http');

http.createServer((request, response) => {
  response.writeHead(200);
  response.end('Hello, World!');
}).listen(3000);

console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
```

We first require node's native http module, then we pass an anon function that runs each time we make a new connection.

The function takes a **_request_** and a response. and send a **_response_** code 200.

We tell the server to **_listen_** for requests from port 3000

### What kind of apps os node.js suited for

- Best for apps that need real-time interaction

### Advantages

- everything happens in the same language

- node loves json making it great for object based DBs

## LocationIQ docs

LocationIQ is an API for enterprise-grade location based solutions. It can be used for routing, creating maps, and geocoding

## Axios docs

> a promise based http client for the browser and node.js

- used for handling requests

- supports promise api

Here's an example of a GET request with axios

```JS
const axios = require('axios');

// Make a request for a user with a given ID
axios.get('/user?ID=12345')
  .then(function (response) {
    // handle success
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    // handle error
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Optionally the request above could also be done as
axios.get('/user', {
    params: {
      ID: 12345
    }
  })
  .then(function (response) {
    console.log(response);
  })
  .catch(function (error) {
    console.log(error);
  })
  .then(function () {
    // always executed
  });

// Want to use async/await? Add the `async` keyword to your outer function/method.
async function getUser() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/user?ID=12345');
    console.log(response);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
}
```

> async and await are parts of es2017, and won't be supported on older browsers

## MDN aysnc/await

> Syntactic sugar on top of promises

Await and async are part of es2017, and they allow use to run code asynchronously. Well, they make it a lot easier.

### using async

async goes before the function declaration, and turns the following code into a promise.

```JS
async function hello() { return "Hello" };
hello();
```

using it with an arrow function looks like this

```JS
let hello = async () => { return "Hello" };
```

Afterwards you can use a **_.then()_** block to handle the promise.

```JS
hello().then((value) => console.log(value))
```

Basically it says when hello() evaluates, then do some thing

### Await

Await allows the code to stop until a promise is fulfilled. This is a basic example

```JS
async function hello() {
  return greeting = await Promise.resolve("Hello");
};

hello().then(alert);
```

Hello() is the promise, that assigns a value to greeting when the promise resolves. Then hello alerts with the greeting.

Here's something a little denser: a snippet for handling requests

```JS
async function myFetch() {
  let response = await fetch('coffee.jpg');
  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  return await response.blob();

}

myFetch().then((blob) => {
  let objectURL = URL.createObjectURL(blob);
  let image = document.createElement('img');
  image.src = objectURL;
  document.body.appendChild(image);
}).catch(e => console.log(e));
```

- each await will wait for the previous one to finish
