# Passing Functions as Props || 04.14.21

## [Lifting State Up](https://reactjs.org/docs/lifting-state-up.html)

What is lifting state? It's where we set a child shares the state of its common ancestor. This works by setting state in a parent component and passing a function down to the children. This function has the ability to manipulate and access the parent's state. Normally, state only flows in one direction. But when two or more components need to share the same state, it neccessary to lift state up. We essentially pass state as a prop.

````JS
  handleChange(e) {
    // Before: this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
    this.props.onTemperatureChange(e.target.value);
    // ...
````

In this example, a child component is passed an event handler (onTemperatureChange) that updates the state of a parent component. Since multiple children share this state, all of them will update because they update from the same value.

Take a look from a birds eye view:

````JS
class Calculator extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleCelsiusChange = this.handleCelsiusChange.bind(this);
    this.handleFahrenheitChange = this.handleFahrenheitChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: '', scale: 'c'};
  }

````

Calculator is the parent that will store state for us. Right now it holds temperature = '' and scale = 'c'

````JS

  handleCelsiusChange(temperature) {
    this.setState({scale: 'c', temperature});
  }

  handleFahrenheitChange(temperature) {
    this.setState({scale: 'f', temperature});
  }

````

Two functions are created to handle input and lift state. These will be passed down to the input component.

````JS
  render() {
    const scale = this.state.scale;
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    const celsius = scale === 'f' ? tryConvert(temperature, toCelsius) : temperature;
    const fahrenheit = scale === 'c' ? tryConvert(temperature, toFahrenheit) : temperature;

````

State is then used to determine which converter to use for which temperature scale. This well then be used by the calculator to render the output.

````JS

    return (
      <div>
        <TemperatureInput
          scale="c"
          temperature={celsius}
          onTemperatureChange={this.handleCelsiusChange} />
        <TemperatureInput
          scale="f"
          temperature={fahrenheit}
          onTemperatureChange={this.handleFahrenheitChange} />
        <BoilingVerdict
          celsius={parseFloat(celsius)} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
````

Finally, we pass props down to the children. The onTemperatureChange will be used to update the state of calculator.

> There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow.

## Lists and Keys

>A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements.

Keys are unique identififers for each list item. They help react know what it's dealing with. For a list, we simply use the index as it will always be unique item to item.

They must be unique among siblings. One reason why you might not want to use the index of list, if you change the order, it will lead to problems.

## [Declaring a Winner](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#declaring-a-winner)

Remember whenever we setState, the component will re-render. Thus, calculate winner works because it checks for a winner each time the state updates, and you get a winner anytime you get 3 of a kind.

## [The Spread Operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab)

> InJavaScript, spread syntax refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

The ... is useful for:

* Copying an array

* Concatenating or combining arrays

* Using Math functions

* Using an array as arguments

* Adding an item to a list

* Adding to state in React

* Combining objects

* Converting NodeList to an array

````JS
const numbers = [37, -17, 7, 0]
console.log(Math.min(numbers)) // NaN
console.log(Math.min(...numbers)) // -17
console.log(Math.max(...numbers)) // 37
````

Here's a handy example. Normally, you can't compute the min or max of an array without checking each value, thus passing the entire array returns NaN. But if we expand the array, it will work.

> **_Question:_**\
what are [ReactDOM](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html) and [useState](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html)?

The latter is a hook, and the former is a way of referencing the DOM: a so-called 'escape hatch' for React.

> One of the benefits of using the spread operator is that it will create a new reference to its primitive values, copying them.
