## [Nosql vs sql (Issac)](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2014/01/sql-vs-nosql-db/?utm_source=tuicool)

- Sql dbs are relational

- nosql dbs are nonrelational typically

- sql dbs are table based

- nosql dbs are document based using key-value pairs to store information

- nosql has a dynamic schema

- sql is vertical
  - they scale with more powerful hardware

- no sql is horizontal
  - scales with more servers

- sql (structured query language) refers to the language that sql dbs use to manipulate and collate data

- nosql dbs are unstructured

- nosql is not good for complex queries whereas sql is

- sql uses ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)

- nosql use CAP (Consistency, Availability, partition tolerance)

### MongoDB

- information is dynamically stored in JSON like documents

- Fast

- Scales well horizontally

- manageable for both devs and admins

- Dynamic shema allows you to modify schema without destroying data

Nosql is for machines?

**Denormalization** refers to the simplification/optimization by copying data into multiple documents or tables

- makes things more query friendly

### Aggregates

- key-value stores and graph dbs typically don't place constraints on values

- composite keys are combinations of keys
  - UserID_name

- "BigTable models support **soft schema** via variable set of columns within a **column family** and a veriable number of **versions** within one cell"

- Document models are schema less

### Aplication side joins

> Joins are rarely supported in NoSQL solutions. As a consequence of the “question-oriented” NoSQL nature, joins are often handled at design time as opposed to relational models where joins are handled at query execution time. Query time joins almost always mean a performance penalty

- what are require joins 

- what is a many to many/many to one relationship
  - "often modeled with links and require joins"

### Atomic Aggregates

- What does atomic mean

- What is a transaction

### Enumberable keys

> Perhaps the greatest benefit of an unordered Key-Value data model is that entries can be partitioned across multiple servers by just hashing the key.
