## Lists, 3

In HTML5 there are three main types of lists ordered lists (with numbers), unordered lists (think bullets), and definition lists (words and their definitions). They also support nesting.

````HTML
<ol>
    <li>im an ordered list</li>
</ol>

<ul>
    <li> im and unordered list <li>
<ul>

<dl>
    <dt>im a definition term</dt>
    <dd>im the definition</dd>
<dl>
````
