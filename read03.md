#Terminals and editors (The Coder's Computer)

The command terminal is useful as a means for navigating a system. Often it can be used in addition to the GUI. It's much faster for instance. The command line does everything the GUI does, but is text-based. 

Navigating the command line is fairly intuititive; most of the command are short for their functions; pwd means print working directory, and it prints the path to the current directory. Ls is short for list, and it lists the files in the current directory. These commands have "options" or arguments that modifier their behaviour:

```
~$ ls -a 
```

'-a' is the option here. This particular command would list all the the files in the current directory, even the hidden ones. Normally, the ls only lists the files which aren't hidden. On a linux system, hidden files are prefixed with a dot. 

```
~$ ls -a
.              Documents                               .node_repl_history  snap
..             Downloads                               .npm                .ssh
.bash_history  .gitconfig                              .nvm                .sudo_as_admin_successful
.bash_logout   .gnupg                                  Pictures            Templates
.bashrc        google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb  .pki                Videos
.cache         .local                                  .profile            .vscode
.config        .mozilla                                .profile.bak
Desktop        Music                                   Public
~$ 
```

You can see which ones would normally be hidden here.

Text editors are pieces of software built for the management and modification of text. Picking the right one isn't easy and there are a ton of options. Some are free like Visual Code and notepad++; a few have trial options: Sublime, BB. Typically, operating systems come with text editors built-in, though their often bare bones: Notepad, Gedit...

Besides text modification, text editors can have extensions and other features: syntax highlighting, code-completion, themes. Extensions are like plugins; they extend the functionality of the existing software.
