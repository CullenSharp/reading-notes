## Images, 5

You can use stock images to give the user more information about the site's contents and purpose. There's a bunch of sites for stock images, and you can store any images you get in a local folder.

All there really is to know about images is their formats and dimensions. The main formats are GIF, PNG, and JPG. All you need to know about that is that. JPGs aren't transparent and compress in ways you never want. GIF can be animated, but also can be a massive file.

Oh I almost forgot about SVGs. They're the best. You can make 'em really big, because they're not fixed to their dimensions. SVG is just equations.
