## Understanding The Problem Domain

What is the "problem domain"? It's "all the stuff that has nothing to do with the language," but what you have to understand in order to write the software ([Stack Exchange, 2011](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125926/what-is-problem-domain)). Say for instance you working on a site to sell kitchen equipment, then the problem domain is ecommerce and cooking. Essentially, the problem domain *is* the bigger picture.

How do you make the problem domain easier to understand? John Sonmez suggests that we either make the problem domain easier or get better at understanding the it. You can start by narrowing your focus to just a few parts. Build the problem out in steps, so it doesn't get overwhelming.

You can also just talk to the customer directly. This ensures that you have a better view of the problem domain.

## Object Literals, 3

An object is a way of modelling something from real world. It has properties and methods (its variables and functions). Here is an example for a hotel:

````JS
let hotel = {
    name: 'Quay',
    rooms: 40,
    booked: 20,
    gym: true,
    types: ['twin', 'double', 'suite'],
    checkAvailability: function() {
        return this.rooms - this.booked;
    }
};

//this is a call to the checkAvailability method
hotel.checkAvailability();
````

An object is composed of comma-seperated attribute and value pairs called key and value. This way the object form is very good at describing something with many parts.

The above code is also an example of the 'literal notation', and the method is accessed using dot notation. But you could also access the values like you would for an array:

````JS

let getAvailable = hotel['checkAvailability']();

````

In this case, think of the key name as the index for each value.
