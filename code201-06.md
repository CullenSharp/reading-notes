## Understanding The Problem Domain

What is the "problem domain"? It's "all the stuff that has nothing to do with the language," but what you have to understand in order to write the software ([Stack Exchange, 2011](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125926/what-is-problem-domain)). Say for instance you working on a site to sell kitchen equipment, then the problem domain is ecommerce and cooking. Essentially, the problem domain *is* the bigger picture.

How do you make the problem domain easier to understand? John Sonmez suggests that we either make the problem domain easier or get better at understanding the it. You can start by narrowing your focus to just a few parts. Build the problem out in steps, so it doesn't get overwhelming.

You can also just talk to the customer directly. This ensures that you have a better view of the problem domain.
