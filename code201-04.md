## Links, 4

Anchor tags are the primary way you create links in HTML. They can take either absolute or relative URLs. An absolute URL is either the full path from the main folder or a URL from the internet. Relative links are based on the location of the file *relative* to the HTML file that linked it.

````HTML
<a href="home">home</a>
<a href="https://some.com">some.com</a>
<a href=/home/cullen/Documents/projects/codefellows/code201/reading-notes/code201-04.md>links</a>
````

Adding mailto: with an email into the href creates an email.

The target attribute determines where the link should open. using target="_blank" will open the link on a new tab.

````HTML
<a href="https://some.com" target="_blank">some.com</a>
````

You can also link to a location on the same page by using an id selector.

````HTML
<a href="#top">top</a>
````

You can link to specific locations on different pages too:

````HTML
<a href="home/#top" target="_blank">home</a>
````

## Layout, 15

If one block element is nested inside of another, the outside block is called a *containing* or *parent* element.

### Positioning in CSS

Normal flow is the default. Each element appears after the last one.

*Relative* positioning removes the element from the normal flow, and allows you to place it to the left, right, top, or bottom without affecting other elements. In essence the element is moved in relation to where it would be in normal flow.

````CSS 
p.1 {
    position: relative;
}
````

*Absolute* placement places the element in relation to its containing element. It also moves as the user scrolls. You can use box offset (top, right,bottom,left) to define the position.

````CSS
p.1 {
    position: absolute;
    top: 100px;
    right: 100px;
    bottom: 100px;
    left: 100px;
}
````

*Fixed* position places the element in relation to the browser's window.

*Floating* elements can be placed to the left or right (of the containing element) breaking normal flow, and allows content to flow around it by becoming a block element. The most important part of this rule is that other elements flow *around* it. 

````CSS
blockquote {
    float: right;
    width: 275px;
    font-size: 130%;
    font-style: italic;
    font-family: Georgia, Times, Serif;
    margin: 0px 0px 10px 10px;
    padding: 10px;
    border-top: 1px solid black;
    border-bottom: 1px solid black; 
}
````

Note: Think about this for a second. The element will be placed to the far right of its containing (or parent) element, be 275px wide. *Set font size 30x larger than the containers font size*. Make the element italic, and set the font to georgia and times new roman. Give 10px of space on the bottom and left and 10px of space between the border and it's contents. Finally, create a 1px wide border on top and bottom in solid black.

The float can also be used to place elements (boxes) side-by-side, though different heights will lead to different placements; to fix this set the height to be the same as the tallest element you want to align with.

Alternatively, you can use 'clear', which says that no element should touch the left or right edge of the container. There are a few more options though: left, right, none, both.

````CSS
p {
    width: 230px;
    float: left;
    margin: 5px;
    padding: 5px;
    background-color: lightgrey;
}

.clear {
    clear: left;
}
````

Clear left prevents the element from touching any other box on its left side. Clear right is the opposite. Clear both prevents touching on both sides, and none means they can touch on any side.

note: *z-index* controls which element will be rendered on top of the other. A z-index of 10 will appear over an element with a z-index of 5.

````CSS
h1 {
    position: fixed;
    top: 0px;
    left: 0px;
    margin: 0px;
    padding: 0px;
    width: 100%;
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
    z-index: 10;
}

.body {
    position: relative;
    top: 70px;
    left: 70px
}
````

Here the header will appear on top of the body because its z-index is higher. By default z-index is 0. Z-index: auto does *not* establish a new stacking context, and it assumed to be the same as it's parent.

Normal flow is also called position: static.

### screen sizes

The safe area for a webpage is 960-1000x570. 

To account for variable screen sizes there are two basic frameworks for layout: fixed, liquid. 

Fixed width layouts don't change based on the user's screen size. The benefit of this is that all positional data is consistent, but you end up with big gaps on the sides. Increased font sizes can cause overflow, and high-resolutions can make the site look small and hard to read. Often fixed width layouts take up more vertical space than liquid layouts.

Liquid layouts change based on the user's device and settings. This is much harder to break, but makes positional data variable (i.e. design will look very different across different devices.)

### grids

Also called the 960 pixel grid, the grid layout is useful for keeping placement consistent across the page.

To create a grid quickly, you can use a *CSS framework*, like 960.gs (short for 960 pixel grid system).

## Funtions, Methods, and Objects, 3

Functions, methods, and objects are used to make code modular, compact, and more readable. Functions and methods are the same thing *essentially*, but a method is declared within an object. 

More specifically, a function is a collection of statements that can be reused at any time. If a function, app, or object has a redundant line of code, maybe you can used a function instead. 

A function is called liked this:

````JS
let someParams = 'im a paramater.';

function anon(someParams) {
    let result = 'this is a function, and '+someParams; 
    return(result);
}

console.log(anon(someParams));
````
