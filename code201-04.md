## Links, 4

Anchor tags are the primary way you create links in HTML. They can take either absolute or relative URLs. An absolute URL is either the full path from the main folder or a URL from the internet. Relative links are based on the location of the file *relative* to the HTML file that linked it.

````HTML
<a href="home">home</a>
<a href="https://some.com">some.com</a>
<a href=/home/cullen/Documents/projects/codefellows/code201/reading-notes/code201-04.md>links</a>
````

Adding mailto: with an email into the href creates an email.

The target attribute determines where the link should open. using target="_blank" will open the link on a new tab.

````HTML
<a href="https://some.com" target="_blank">some.com</a>
````

You can also link to a location on the same page by using an id selector.

````HTML
<a href="#top">top</a>
````

You can link to specific locations on different pages too:

````HTML
<a href="home/#top" target="_blank">home</a>
````
